# HR System - Employee Management

## Overview

This project is a simple HR System for managing employee information, calculating salaries, and displaying the details on a webpage. The system is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Employee Class:** Implemented a JavaScript class `GenerateAnEmployee` to create employee objects with attributes such as Employee ID, Full Name, Department, Level, Salary, and Image URL.

- **Salary Calculation:** Developed a prototype function `calcSalary` within the class to calculate the gross salary based on the employee's level using predefined salary ranges and apply a tax rate.

- **Rendering Employee Information:** Created a prototype function `empolyeeSalaryAndName` to render each employee's name and gross salary on the home webpage.

- **Employee Cards:** Introduced a prototype function `employeeCard` to display employee information in separate cards on the homepage. Employee images are sourced directly from a public GitHub repository.

- **Styling:** Styled the webpage using CSS, including a header with navigation links, a main content area, and a fixed footer with social media links and copyright information.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the Home Page.

3. Explore the employee details and salaries displayed on the Home Page.

## How to Run

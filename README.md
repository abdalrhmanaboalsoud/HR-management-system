# HR System - Employee Management

## Overview

This project is a simple HR System for managing employee information, calculating salaries, and displaying the details on a webpage. The system is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Employee Class:** Implemented a JavaScript class `GenerateAnEmployee` to create employee objects with attributes such as Employee ID, Full Name, Department, Level, Salary, and Image URL.

- **Salary Calculation:** Developed a prototype function `calcSalary` within the class to calculate the gross salary based on the employee's level using predefined salary ranges and apply a tax rate.

- **Rendering Employee Information:** Created a prototype function `empolyeeSalaryAndName` to render each employee's name and gross salary on the home webpage.

- **Styling:** Styled the webpage using CSS, including a header with navigation links, a main content area, and a fixed footer with social media links and copyright information.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the Home Page.
2. Navigate to the "Accounting" page for additional features (to be implemented).
3. Explore the employee details and salaries displayed on the Home Page.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

Feel free to customize and extend the functionality according to your HR system requirements.
